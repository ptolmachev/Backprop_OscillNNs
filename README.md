Backprop_OscillNNs


Continuous backprop algorithm for the oscillatory NNs to recover the connectivity parameters of the network given the reference signal. The code is based on the idea described in [Peter F Rowat & Allen I Selverston (1991) Learning algorithms for oscillatory networks with gap junctions and membrane currents, Network: Computation in Neural Systems, 2:1, 17-41]
